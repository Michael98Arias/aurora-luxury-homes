Aurora Luxury Homes

Aurora Luxury Homes is a web application for displaying real estate property data. Built with React/Next.js, it integrates a Retool API for authentication and property information, Zustand for state management, Material UI for components, SCSS for custom styling, and i18n for multi-language support. The project emphasizes a clean, responsive, and modular architecture, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
